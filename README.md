Pure (minimalistic) Yellow Theme
=================
I have created this theme with the intention to use minimal css and js. It ended up with no js 
and only about 7kb of css (with fontello for icons the gzip size for the homepage is about 10kb).
The theme was originally inspired by purecss.io. However, since I didn't use many features I created
my own css file with everything needed for me.

How do I install this?
----------------------
1. Download and install [Yellow](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow/).  
2. Download the whole repo and drop it into system folder
3. Create folders in content for blog, contact and search

To uninstall delete everything you copied.

How to configure the theme?
